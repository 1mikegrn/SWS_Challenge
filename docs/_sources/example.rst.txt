Example
=======

Windows
+++++++

On the Windows operating system this module can be run directly through the
command line with Python having been installed and added to the OS PATH. The
module can be installed directly from GitHub using `pip` and `git`

With the module installed, simply pass to the command line the console script
:code:`SWS_Challenge <input.txt>` where :code:`<input.txt>` is an input file of 
the required format. For example:

.. image:: /images/T1.jpg

can be passed to the module as such:

.. image:: /images/CMD2.jpg

alternatively, two files and a keyword can be passed to the console script of
the following formats:

:code:`grid.txt`

.. image:: /images/T2.jpg

:code:`words.txt`

.. image:: /images/T3.jpg

where the :code:`WRAP` or :code:`NO_WRAP` argument is tagged to the end of the
script command. The results will print directly to the console.

In Linux, installation and operation is the same as it is on Windows.
